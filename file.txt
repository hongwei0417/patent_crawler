       <BR><BR>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
<BR><BR>[0001] This application is a continuation application of U.S. Ser. No.
     13/915,967, filed Jun. 12, 2013, which claims the benefit of Korean
     Patent Application No. 10-2012-0066047, filed on Jun. 20, 2012 in the
     Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is
     incorporated herein by reference.
       <BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR>[0002] 1. Field
<BR><BR>[0003] One or more embodiments relate to an X-ray imaging apparatus and an
     X-ray imaging system, which obtain an X-ray image of bones or soft
     tissues of an object using a plurality of X-rays with different energy
     levels.
<BR><BR>[0004] 2. Description of the Related Art
<BR><BR>[0005] An X-ray imaging apparatus irradiates an object with X-rays and
     analyzes X-rays transmitted through the object to examine an internal
     structure of the object. X-ray transmittance may differ according to
     tissues constituting the object. Thus, the internal structure of the
     object may be imaged using an attenuation coefficient obtained by
     indicating the transmittance as a numeric value.
<BR><BR>[0006] Recently, a method of forming an X-ray image by irradiating X-rays
     with different energy levels, but not by irradiating X-rays with the same
     energy level has been developed and various research thereon has been
     conducted.
<BR><BR>[0007] In particular, a dual energy X-ray imaging apparatus sequentially
     irradiates to an object with first energy X-rays and second energy X-rays
     to capture a plurality of radiography images and extracts clear and
     separate bone and soft tissue images, that is, a bone image clearly
     indicating bones and a soft tissue image clearly indicating soft tissues,
     from the radiography images.
<BR><BR>[0008] In this case, when the bone image and soft tissue image extracted
     from an entire X-ray image are displayed, it takes a long time for a user
     to diagnose a lesion. In addition, when the user wants to check a bone or
     soft tissue image corresponding to only a part that is suspected to have
     a lesion, the user's need is not satisfied by a generated image.
<BR><BR>[0009] In addition, the X-ray imaging apparatus transmits the bone or soft
     tissue image together with a first energy X-ray image or a second energy
     X-ray image to a picture archiving & communication system (PACS),
     resulting in burden to server capacity of the PACS.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR>[0010] Therefore, the foregoing described problems may be overcome and/or
     other aspects may be achieved by one or more embodiments of an X-ray
     imaging apparatus that displays a bone or soft tissue image of an X-ray
     image, which corresponds to a region selected by a user, thereby reducing
     a diagnosis time.
<BR><BR>[0011] The foregoing described problems may be overcome and/or other
     aspects may be achieved by one or more embodiments of an X-ray imaging
     system in which a first energy X-ray image and a second energy X-ray
     image are transmitted to a central image management system, and a user
     control apparatus receives the images from the central image management
     system and displays a bone or soft tissue image corresponding to the
     selected region, thereby reducing burden imposed on server capacity of
     the central image management system as well as reducing a diagnosis time.
<BR><BR>[0012] Additional aspects and/or advantages of one or more embodiments
     will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part,
     will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of
     one or more embodiments of disclosure. One or more embodiments are

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>[0083] Reference will now be made in detail to one or more embodiments,
     illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals
     refer to like elements throughout. In this regard, embodiments of the
     present invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not
     be construed as being limited to embodiments set forth herein, as various
     changes, modifications, and equivalents of the systems, apparatuses
     and/or methods described herein will be understood to be included in the
     invention by those of ordinary skill in the art after embodiments
     discussed herein are understood. Accordingly, embodiments are merely
     described below, by referring to the figures, to explain aspects of the
     present invention.
<BR><BR>[0084] FIG. 1 is a control block diagram of an X-ray imaging apparatus 100
     according one or more embodiments and FIG. 2 is a diagram of an overall
     structure of an X-ray imaging apparatus, such as the X-ray imaging
     apparatus 100 of FIG. 1. As described below, the imaging apparatus uses
     X-rays to form images. However, other forms of electro-magnetic radiation
     may also be used.
<BR><BR>[0085] Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the X-ray imaging apparatus 100 may
     include an X-ray generator 110 to generate X-rays and irradiate an object
     with the X-rays, an X-ray detector 120 to detect X-rays transmitted
     through the object, and a host device 130 to generate X-ray images using
     the detected X-rays.
<BR><BR>[0086] The X-ray generator 110 may receive power from a power supply (not
     shown) to generate the X-rays and may irradiate the object with the
     X-rays. The X-ray generator 110 may generate X-rays which have an
     appropriate energy level to an examination target portion of the object,
     that is, an X-ray imaging portion. Energy and intensity of the irradiated
     X-rays may differ according to the power supplied from the power supply
     and an exposure time of the X-rays. In detail, the energy of the X-rays
     may be controlled according to an applied tube voltage, and the intensity
     or dose of the X-rays may be controlled according to tube current and the
     exposure time of the X-rays.
<BR><BR>[0087] The X-ray generator 110 may irradiate monochromatic X-rays or
     polychromatic X-rays. According to one or more embodiments, the X-ray
     generator 110 may irradiate polychromatic X-rays having a predetermined
     energy band which is defined by an upper limit and a lower limit.
<BR><BR>[0088] The upper limit of the energy band, that is, maximum energy of the
     irradiated X-rays may be controlled according to an amplitude of the tube
     voltage and the lower limit of the energy band, that is, minimum energy
     of the irradiated X-rays may be controlled by a filter that is installed
     inside or outside the X-ray generator 110. When X-rays in a low energy
     band are filtered by the filter, average energy of the irradiated X-rays
     may increase. Thus, an energy level of X-rays may be controlled by
     adjusting the energy band of the X-rays.
<BR><BR>[0089] The X-ray detector 120 may detect the X-rays transmitted through
     the object. The X-rays irradiated by the X-ray generator 110 may pass
     through the object and may be attenuated while passing through the
     object. In this regard, transmittance of the X-rays may differ according
     to tissues constituting a portion to which the X-rays are irradiated, and
     thus, the amount of the transmitted X-rays may differ according to
     positions to which the X-rays are irradiated.
<BR><BR>[0090] Tissues having different X-ray transmittances may be broadly
     classified, for example, into adipose tissue, soft tissue such as muscle
     and blood, tissue containing a large amount of calcium, such as bone and
     tooth, and gas. Thus, the amount of the transmitted X-rays may differ
     according to whether the X-rays are irradiated to bone, soft tissue, gas,
     or adipose tissue.
<BR><BR>[0091] The X-ray detector 120 may detect the X-rays transmitted through
     the object, may convert the X-rays into an electric signal, and may
     transmit the electric signal to the host device 130. In this case, the
     X-ray detector 120 may detect a plurality of X-rays with different energy
     levels. In this regard, an example of a method of detecting a plurality
     of X-rays may include a method of separately irradiating a plurality of
     X-rays with different energy levels by the X-ray generator 110 and a
     method of extracting and detecting X-rays with a desired energy level by
     the X-ray detector 120.
<BR><BR>[0092] In the former method, the X-ray generator 110 may separately
     generate and irradiates the X-rays with different energy levels, the
     X-ray detector 120 may detect the X-rays and may transmit the X-rays to
     the host device 130, and the host device 130 may form images of the
     X-rays via an image process. This method is well known in the art, and
     thus, a detailed description thereof is omitted here.
<BR><BR>[0093] In the latter method, the X-ray generator 110 may irradiate X-rays
     once and the X-ray detector 120 which includes a photon counting detector
     (PCD) may divide the X-rays according to energy levels.
<BR><BR>[0094] In detail, when the X-rays transmitted through the object reaches a
     photo diode region of the PCD, electrons in a valence band may receive
     photon energy of the X-rays sufficient to exceed a band gap energy
     difference and may be excited to a conduction band. Due to such
     excitation, a large amount of electron-hole pairs may be generated in a
     depletion region and moved by an electric field such that current flows.
     In this regard, the amount of the current may be detected to obtain data
     about intensity of X-rays that reach a pixel through the object. Then, a
     plurality of data of pixels may be collected to form one planar image.
<BR><BR>[0095] The PCD may convert current according to flow of the electron-hole
     pairs generated whenever photons corresponding to energy of the X-rays
     are incident on the PCD into a voltage signal, may amplify the voltage
     signal, and may input the amplified voltage signal to a comparer. The
     comparer may compare the amplified voltage signal with a reference
     voltage to output a pulse. A counter may count the output pulse of the
     comparer per unit time to measure the intensity of the incident X-rays.
<BR><BR>[0096] According to one or more embodiments, a method of detecting X-rays
     with different energy levels is not particularly limited. Thus, the
     above-described two methods may be used and other methods may also be
     used.
<BR><BR>[0097] The number of the different energy levels is not limited. However,
     hereinafter, for convenience of description, a case in which X-rays with
     two different energy levels are detected will be described.
<BR><BR>[0098] The host device 130 may generate the X-ray images using an X-ray
     signal detected by the X-ray detector 120 and may display at least one of
     the X-ray images.
<BR><BR>[0099] In detail, when the X-rays with different energy levels are
     respectively referred to as a first energy X-ray and a second energy
     X-ray, the host device 130 may generate a first energy X-ray image using
     the first energy X-ray and may generate a second energy X-ray image using
     the second energy X-ray.
<BR><BR>[0100] In addition, the host device 130 may display at least one of the
     first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image and may
     display a bone or soft tissue image corresponding to a region that is
     selected by a user from the displayed X-ray image. Here, the bone image
     and the soft tissue image may be separated from each other and extracted
     from the displayed X-ray image.
<BR><BR>[0101] The overall structure shown in FIG. 2 is a just one exemplary
     embodiment. X-ray imaging may be performed when the object lies down or
     sits down. The present embodiment is not limited to the positions of
     elements shown in FIG. 2 so long as the X-ray imaging apparatus 100
     includes elements that perform the above-described functions.
<BR><BR>[0102] Hereinafter, an operation of the host device 130 will be described
     in detail.
<BR><BR>[0103] FIG. 3 is a control block diagram showing a detailed structure of a
     host device, such as the host device 130 of the X-ray imaging apparatus
     100 of FIG. 1.
<BR><BR>[0104] Referring to FIG. 3, the host device 130 may include an X-ray image
     generator 131 to generate the X-ray images based on the detected X-ray
     signal, an image information extractor 132 to extract image information
     about bones and soft tissues from the X-ray image, an input unit 133 to
     receive user selection, and an image display unit 134 to display the
     generated images.
<BR><BR>[0105] The X-ray image generator 131 may generate the X-ray images by
     image processing the X-ray signal detected by the X-ray detector 120. In
     detail, the X-ray image generator 131 may generate the first energy X-ray
     image from a first energy X-ray signal and may generate the second energy
     X-ray image from a second energy X-ray signal. An image processing
     technique utilized by the X-ray image generator 131 may be one of well
     known image processing techniques used to generate an X-ray image.
<BR><BR>[0106] The image display unit 134 may display at least one of the first
     energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image that are generated
     by the X-ray image generator 131. According to one or more embodiments,
     the image display unit 134 may display a high energy X-ray image of the
     two images. When two X-ray images with different levels are generated,
     one may be a high energy X-ray image and the other one may be a low
     energy X-ray image. An X-ray image that is more easily analyzed may vary
     according to a diagnosis target. For example, when the diagnosis target
     is a chest, a high energy X-ray image may be displayed. With regard to
     breasts, a low energy X-ray image may be displayed. In addition, it may
     be possible to display both the high energy X-ray image and the low
     energy X-ray image.
<BR><BR>[0107] The image information extractor 132 may extract bone images and
     soft tissue images from the first energy X-ray image and the second
     energy X-ray image to extract bone image information about a bone or soft
     tissue image information about a soft tissue. Here, bone is in contrast
     to soft tissue and may include calcified hard tissues and the like in
     addition to a bone of a body.
<BR><BR>[0108] In detail, the image information extractor 132 may extract the bone
     image information and the soft tissue image information from the first
     energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image, respectively, using
     an attenuation characteristic difference therebetween.
<BR><BR>[0109] The transmittance or attenuation rate of X-rays varies according to
     a material through which they pass. An X-ray image indicates an internal
     structure of the object using this characteristic. The bone and the soft
     tissue have different transmittances with respect to X-rays of the same
     energy level. In this case, when an energy level of the X-rays is
     changed, a transmittance difference between the bone and the soft tissue
     is changed.
<BR><BR>[0110] The image information extractor 132 may extract the bone image
     information which indicates the bone by reducing a residual image of the
     soft tissue of the X-ray images or the soft tissue information which
     indicates the soft tissue by reducing a residual image of the bone of the
     X-ray images, using the transmittance characteristic or attenuation
     characteristic of the bone and soft tissue.
<BR><BR>[0111] In addition, the image information extractor 132 may generate the
     bone image containing the bone image information or the soft tissue image
     containing the soft tissue image information. Here, the bone image
     indicates the bone by reducing the residual image of the soft tissue and
     the soft tissue image indicates the soft tissue by reducing the residual
     image of the bone.
<BR><BR>[0112] According to one or more embodiments, in order to extract the bone
     image information or the soft tissue image information, dual energy X-ray
     absoptiometry (DEXA), which is well known, may be used. The DEXA is a
     method of extracting image information clearly indicating a desired
     portion of bone and soft tissue by extracting images from high energy
     X-rays and low energy X-rays, logarithmically expressing the images,
     applying appropriate weights to the images, and then obtaining a
     difference therebetween.
<BR><BR>[0113] However, the DEXA is just one image information extraction
     algorithm that may be used by the image information extractor 132. Thus,
     the image information extractor 132 may apply various algorithms to
     extract the bone image information or the soft tissue image information.
<BR><BR>[0114] The input unit 133 may receive user selection of at least one
     region of the X-ray image on the image display unit 134. The input unit
     133 may be embodied, for example, by any one of a mouse, a trackball, a
     keyboard, and a touch pad, etc. When the image display unit 134 is
     embodied as a touchscreen, for example, the touchscreen may function as
     both the input unit 133 and the image display unit 134.
<BR><BR>[0115] When the user selection is input to the input unit 133, the image
     display unit 134 may display a portion of the bone image or soft tissue
     image, which corresponds to the selected region.
<BR><BR>[0116] Hereinafter, operations of the image display unit 134 and the image
     information extractor 132 according to the user selection will be
     described.
<BR><BR>[0117] FIGS. 4A to 4C are diagrams showing images displayed on the image
     display unit 134, according to one or more embodiments. FIG. 4A shows a
     first energy X-ray image 11 displayed on an image display unit, such as
     the image display unit 134, FIG. 4B shows a bone image displayed
     according to user selection, and FIG. 4C shows a soft tissue image
     displayed according to user selection.
<BR><BR>[0118] As shown in FIG. 4A, the first energy X-ray image 11 generated by
     the X-ray image generator 131 may be displayed on the image display unit
     134. According to one or more embodiments, first energy may be high
     energy. When the first energy X-ray image 11 is displayed on the image
     display unit 134, a user, that is, an inspector may analyze the first
     energy X-ray image 11 to perform diagnosis.
<BR><BR>[0119] The user may find a region that is suspected to have a lesion
     during the diagnosis through the first energy X-ray image 11. In this
     case, the input unit 133 may receive user selection of a corresponding
     region from the user. As shown in FIG. 4A, a selected region 11a may have
     a predetermined area. When the input unit 133 is embodied, for example,
     as a mouse, a trackball, a keyboard, a touch pad, or the like, the user
     may manipulate the input unit 133 to input user selection of at least one
     region of the X-ray image displayed on the image display unit 134. When
     the input unit 133 and the image display unit 134 are embodied, for
     example, as a touchscreen, the user may directly touch a desired region
     of the X-ray image displayed on the touchscreen to input the user
     selection.
<BR><BR>[0120] The image information extractor 132 may perform operations
     corresponding to one or more embodiments. Primarily, when the user
     selection is input through the input unit 133, the image information
     extractor 132 may extract bone image information or soft tissue image
     information of the selected region 11a only and may generate an image
     containing the extracted information. Secondly, the image information
     extractor 132 may extract bone image information or soft tissue image
     information of an entire portion of the first energy X-ray image 11
     regardless of the user selection and then may generate a bone or soft
     tissue image of the selected region 11a only when the user selection is
     input to the input unit 133.
<BR><BR>[0121] As shown in FIG. 4B, the image display unit 134 may display the
     bone image corresponding to the selected region 11a. Alternatively, as
     shown in FIG. 4C, the image display unit 134 may display the soft tissue
     image corresponding to the selected region 11a.
<BR><BR>[0122] As shown in FIGS. 4B and 4C, when the bone image or the soft tissue
     image replaces the selected region 11a of the first energy X-ray image 11
     displayed on the image display unit 134 and is displayed, the user may
     recognize a position of the region that is suspected have a lesion and a
     relationship with other regions during the diagnosis.
<BR><BR>[0123] FIGS. 5A and 5B are diagrams showing images displayed on an image
     display unit, such as the image display unit 134, according to one or
     more embodiments.
<BR><BR>[0124] As described with reference to FIG. 4A, the first energy X-ray
     image 11 may be displayed on the image display unit 134. When user
     selection is input through the input unit 133, the image display unit 134
     may replace an entire portion of the first energy X-ray image 11 with a
     bone or soft tissue image corresponding to the selected region 11a and
     may display the bone or soft tissue image, as shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B.
     In this case, a region that is suspected to have a lesion is enlarged to
     possibly facilitate diagnosis of the region that is suspected to have the
     lesion.
<BR><BR>[0125] The input unit 133 may also receive user selection about whether
     the bone image or soft tissue image of the selected region 11a is to be
     displayed. When the display of the soft tissue image is selected, the
     soft tissue image corresponding to the selected region 11a may be
     displayed, as shown in FIGS. 4B and 5A. When the display of the bone
     image is selected, the bone image corresponding to the selected region
     11a may be displayed, as shown in FIGS. 4C and 5B.
<BR><BR>[0126] The input unit 133 may also receive user selection of the size of
     the bone image or soft tissue image corresponding to the selected region
     11a. In this case, the image display unit 134 may display the bone image
     or soft tissue image of which the size is adjusted according to the user
     selection.
<BR><BR>[0127] Hereinafter, an X-ray imaging apparatus according to one or more
     embodiments will be described.
<BR><BR>[0128] FIG. 6 is a control block diagram of an X-ray imaging apparatus,
     such as X-ray imaging apparatus 200 according to one or more embodiments.
<BR><BR>[0129] Referring to FIG. 6, the X-ray imaging apparatus 200 may include an
     X-ray generator 210, an X-ray detector 220, and a host device 230. In
     addition, the host device 230 may include an X-ray image generator 231 to
     generate an X-ray image, an image information extractor 232 to extract
     bone and soft tissue image information from the X-ray image, an input
     unit 235 to receive user selection, and an image display unit 234 to
     display the X-ray image.
<BR><BR>[0130] The host device 230 of the X-ray imaging apparatus 200 may further
     include an image controller 233 to generate one image containing both the
     bone image information and the soft tissue image information.
     Hereinafter, an operation of the image controller 233 will be described
     in detail.
<BR><BR>[0131] When a user analyzes a region that is suspected to have a lesion,
     an image indicating soft tissues only or an image indicating bones only
     may be useful, but an image indicating both the bones and the soft
     tissues may be used to check a relationship between the bones and the
     soft tissues.
<BR><BR>[0132] Thus, the image information extractor 232 of the X-ray imaging
     apparatus 200 may extract both the bone image information indicating
     bones and the soft tissue image information indicating the soft tissues,
     and the image controller 233 may generate one image containing both the
     bone image information and the soft tissue image information and may
     output the one image on the image display unit 234.
<BR><BR>[0133] Also, the X-ray imaging apparatus 200 may extract image information
     about only the selected region and display the one image or alternatively
     may extract image information regardless of user selection and display
     the one image corresponding to the selected image only.
<BR><BR>[0134] FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 7C are diagrams showing images displayed on an
     image display unit, such as the image display unit 234 of the X-ray
     imaging apparatus 200, according to one or more embodiments.
<BR><BR>[0135] As shown in FIG. 7A, when a user selects at least one region, that
     is, the selected region 11a of the first energy X-ray image 11 displayed
     on the image display unit 234, an image corresponding to the selected
     region 11a may replace the selected region 11a and may be displayed, as
     shown in FIG. 7B. The image may contain both the bone image information
     and soft tissue image information of the selected region 11a, and that
     is, may indicate both the bones and soft tissues of the selected region
     11a. In addition, as shown in FIG. 7C, the image containing both the bone
     image information and soft tissue image information of the selected
     region 11a may be enlarged and displayed on an entire portion of the
     image display unit 234.
<BR><BR>[0136] In addition, when the image controller 233 generates the image
     containing the bone image information and the soft tissue image
     information, the image controller 233 may adjust bone and soft tissue
     regions of the image to different brightness levels such that the bones
     and the soft tissues may be distinguished from each other.
<BR><BR>[0137] According to one or more embodiments, the image controller 233 may
     further include a brightness adjusting filter. The brightness adjusting
     filter may adjust pixel values corresponding to the bone or soft tissue
     region of the image containing the bone image information and the soft
     tissue image information such that the bone region and the soft tissue
     region may exhibit different brightness levels. In this case, a lighter
     region of the bone region and the soft tissue region may be optionally
     set by the image controller 233 or may be determined by user selection
     input to the input unit 235.
<BR><BR>[0138] When the bone region is set to be lighter than the soft tissue
     region, the brightness of all pixels corresponding to the bone region of
     the one image containing the bone image information and the soft tissue
     image information may be multiplied by a predetermined value such that
     the bone region may be displayed lighter than the soft tissue region,
     which may be performed using the brightness adjusting filter.
<BR><BR>[0139] When the soft tissue region is set to be lighter than the bone
     region, the brightness of all pixels corresponding to the soft tissue
     region of the one image containing the bone image information and the
     soft tissue image information may be multiplied by a predetermined value
     such that the soft tissue region may be displayed lighter than the bone
     region, which may be performed using the brightness adjusting filter.
<BR><BR>[0140] According to one or more embodiments, any one of the bone region
     and the soft tissue region may be adjusted to be lighter or darker than
     the other such that the bone region and the soft tissue region may
     exhibit at different brightness levels. That is, the image controller 233
     may adjust the bone region and the soft tissue region to be lighter or
     darker than each other.
<BR><BR>[0141] In addition, when the image controller 233 generates the image
     containing the bone image information and the soft tissue image
     information, the image controller 233 may map the bone region and the
     soft tissue region to different color channels, respectively, so as to
     distinguish the bone image and the soft tissue image from each other.
<BR><BR>[0142] The image controller 233 may map the bone image information and the
     soft tissue image information that are extracted from the image
     information extractor 232 to the different color channels, respectively.
     That is, the image controller 233 may map the bone region corresponding
     to the bone image information and the soft tissue region corresponding to
     the soft tissue image information to the different color channels,
     respectively.
<BR><BR>[0143] In general, an X-ray image is presented in grayscale, that is, in
     black and white as opposed to color channels. However, according to one
     or more embodiments, the bone image information and the soft tissue image
     information may be mapped to the color channels so as to distinguish the
     bone image and the soft tissue image of one image from each other based
     on a color difference therebetween. According to one or more embodiments,
     any color model may be used such that the color model includes at least
     two colors, and thus, the type of the color model is not particularly
     limited.
<BR><BR>[0144] For example, with regard to a red-green-blue (RGB) model, the image
     controller 233 may map the bone image information and the soft tissue
     image information to a red channel and a green channel, respectively, and
     may generate and output one image containing the bone image information
     and the soft tissue image information. Thus, the bone region and the soft
     tissue region of the one image may be displayed in red and green,
     respectively, so as to be distinguished from each other.
<BR><BR>[0145] A portion of the image where the bones and the soft tissues overlap
     may be displayed in a mixed color of red and green. In this regard, when
     density of the bones is higher, red may be displayed more strongly. When
     density of the soft tissue is higher, green may be displayed more
     strongly.
<BR><BR>[0146] The user may recognize how many degrees of the bones and the soft
     tissues exist in a corresponding portion through colors of the portion
     and may distinguish the bone and the soft tissues during the diagnosis.
<BR><BR>[0147] Respective colors mapped to the bone image information and the soft
     tissue image information may be input through the input unit 235 and may
     be optionally set by the image controller 233.
<BR><BR>[0148] FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of a data structure of one image
     generated by color mapping of an image controller according to one or
     more embodiments, such as the image controller 233.
<BR><BR>[0149] Referring to FIG. 8, the one image containing the bone image
     information and the soft tissue image information may be divided into a
     plurality of pixels (n.times.n) each of which may contain bone image
     information and soft tissue information. Thus, when the bone image
     information and the soft tissue information are mapped to color channels
     CHANNEL 1 and CHANNEL 2 indicating different colors, image information of
     each pixel may be stored in a corresponding color channel, as shown in
     FIG. 8.
<BR><BR>[0150] However, the data structure shown in FIG. 8 is just an example. A
     method of mapping the bone and soft tissue image information to color
     channels or a color mapping data structure is not limited to the
     above-described example.
<BR><BR>[0151] In addition, the image controller 233 may perform color mapping on
     an entire region of the first energy X-ray image 11 and may display a
     selected region only, or alternatively, may perform the color mapping on
     the selected region only.
<BR><BR>[0152] FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram of an image that is generated and
     displayed via color mapping of an image controller, such as the image
     controller 233, according to one or more embodiments. In the image shown
     in FIG. 9, bones are mapped to a red color denoted by dot patterns.
<BR><BR>[0153] When a user selects at least one region, that is, the selected
     region 11a of the first energy X-ray image 11 displayed on the image
     display unit 234, the selected region 11a, which includes both the bone
     region and the soft tissue region, may be displayed. Here, the bone
     region and the soft tissue region may be replaced by images with
     different colors.
<BR><BR>[0154] However, in the example illustrated by FIG. 9, the selected region
     11a does not include the soft tissue region. Thus, only the bone region
     is indicated by the dot patterns in FIG. 9. In addition, the size of the
     selected region 11a may be enlarged according to user setting.
<BR><BR>[0155] According to one or more embodiments, in the X-ray imaging
     apparatus 100 and 200, when the user selects a region that is suspected
     to have a lesion during diagnosis on a high energy X-ray image, the soft
     tissue image, the bone image, or the image containing both the soft
     tissue image and the bone image with respect to the selected region only
     may be output such that the user may perform the diagnosis.
<BR><BR>[0156] Hereinafter, an X-ray imaging system will be described with regard
     to one or more embodiments.
<BR><BR>[0157] FIG. 10 is a control block diagram of an X-ray imaging system 300
     according to one or more embodiments and FIG. 11 is a diagram of an
     overall structure of an X-ray imaging system according to one or more
     embodiments, such as the X-ray imaging system 300 of FIG. 10.
<BR><BR>[0158] Referring to FIGS. 10 and 11, the X-ray imaging system 300 may
     include an X-ray imaging apparatus 310 to generate a first energy X-ray
     image and a second energy X-ray image, and a user control apparatus 320
     to extract bone image information and soft tissue image information from
     the first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image.
<BR><BR>[0159] In a medical institution such as a hospital or a health care
     center, for example, an X-ray image generated by the X-ray imaging
     apparatus 310 may be transmitted to and stored in a central image
     management system 20, that is, for example, a picture archiving &
     communication system (PACS), and a user downloads the X-ray image to the
     user control apparatus 320 such as a personal computer (PC) of the user
     from the PACS and analyzes the X-ray image to perform a diagnosis.
<BR><BR>[0160] Conventionally, an X-ray imaging apparatus also generates separate
     bone and soft tissue images which are extracted from an X-ray image of an
     object and transmits the bone and soft tissue images to the PACS.
     However, in the X-ray imaging system 300 according to one or more
     embodiments, the X-ray imaging apparatus 310 may generate the first
     energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image and may transmit the
     first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image to the central
     image management system 20. Then, the user control apparatus 320 may
     download the first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image
     from the central image management system 20 and may generate a required
     bone or soft tissue image using the first energy X-ray image and the
     second energy X-ray image.
<BR><BR>[0161] The X-ray imaging apparatus 310 may include an X-ray generator 311
     to generate and irradiate X-rays, an X-ray detector 312 to detect the
     irradiated X-rays, and a host device 313 to generate an X-ray image using
     the detected X-rays.
<BR><BR>[0162] The X-ray detector 312 may detect a plurality of X-rays with
     different energy levels. As described with reference to FIG. 1, a method
     of detecting a plurality of X-rays may include a method of separately
     irradiating a plurality of X-rays with different energy levels by the
     X-ray generator 311 and a method of extracting and detecting X-rays with
     a desired energy level by the X-ray detector 312.
<BR><BR>[0163] The number of different energy levels is not particularly limited.
     Hereinafter, as only an example, two different energy levels are used and
     X-rays with the two different energy levels are referred to as a first
     energy X-ray and a second energy X-ray, respectively. Here, the first
     energy may be high energy and the second energy may be low energy or vice
     versa.
<BR><BR>[0164] The host device 313 may generate the first energy X-ray image and
     the second energy X-ray image using an X-ray signal detected by the X-ray
     detector 312 and may transmit the first energy X-ray image and the second
     energy X-ray image to the central image management system 20.
<BR><BR>[0165] The first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image may
     be transmitted from the host device 313 directly to the user control
     apparatus 320.
<BR><BR>[0166] The user control apparatus 320 may include a receiver 321 to
     receive the X-ray image, an image display unit 323 to display the X-ray
     image, an input unit 324 to receive user selection, and an image
     information extractor 322 to extract bone and soft tissue image
     information from the X-ray image.
<BR><BR>[0167] The receiver 321 may receive the first energy X-ray image and the
     second energy X-ray image from the central image management system 20 or
     the X-ray imaging apparatus 310.
<BR><BR>[0168] The image display unit 323 may display at least one of the first
     energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image. For example, the
     image display unit 323 may display a high energy X-ray image of the first
     energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image for image diagnosis.
<BR><BR>[0169] The image information extractor 322 may extract the bone image
     information which indicates bones and the soft tissue image information
     which indicates soft tissues from the first energy X-ray image and the
     second energy X-ray image as in the image information extractor 132 of
     the X-ray imaging apparatus 100 described above with reference to FIG. 1.
<BR><BR>[0170] The input unit 324 may receive the user selection of at least one
     region of the X-ray image displayed on the image display unit 323. When a
     user finds a portion suspected to have a lesion during the diagnosis of
     the X-ray image displayed on the image display unit 323, the user may
     specify and select that portion. The input unit 324 may be embodied, for
     example, as a mouse, a trackball, a touch pad, a keyboard, or the like.
     When the image display unit 323 is embodied as a touchscreen, for
     example, the touchscreen may perform functions of both the image display
     unit 323 and the input unit 324.
<BR><BR>[0171] In addition, the input unit 324 may also receive user selection
     about whether the bone image or soft tissue image of a selected region is
     generated.
<BR><BR>[0172] The image information extractor 322 may generate the bone or soft
     tissue image corresponding to the selected region and may display the
     bone or soft tissue image on the image display unit 323. Here, only the
     bone or soft tissue image information corresponding to the selected
     region may be extracted, or alternatively, the bone or soft tissue image
     information corresponding to the entire X-ray image may be extracted
     regardless of the user selection and then only the bone or soft tissue
     image corresponding to the selected region may be generated.
<BR><BR>[0173] FIGS. 12A, 12B, and 12C are diagrams showing images displayed on an
     image display unit according to one or more embodiments, such as the
     image display unit 323 of the user control apparatus 320.
<BR><BR>[0174] As shown in FIG. 12A, when the first energy X-ray image is
     displayed on the image display unit 323, the user may specify and select
     a desired region through the input unit 324. When the user selection is
     input, the bone or soft tissue image may replace the selected region and
     may be displayed, as shown in FIG. 12B. Alternatively, the bone or soft
     tissue image corresponding to the selected region 11a may replace the
     entire first energy X-ray image 11 and may be displayed, as shown in FIG.
     12C.
<BR><BR>[0175] User selection of the size of the bone or soft tissue image may be
     received through the input unit 324 and the bone or soft tissue image
     corresponding to the selected size may be displayed.
<BR><BR>[0176] FIG. 13 is a control block diagram of an X-ray imaging system 400
     according to another embodiment of the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0177] Referring to FIG. 13, the X-ray imaging system 400 may include an
     X-ray imaging apparatus 410 to generate a first energy X-ray image and a
     second energy X-ray image and to transmit the first energy X-ray image
     and the second energy X-ray image to the central image management system
     20 or a user control apparatus 420, and the user control apparatus 420 to
     receive the first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image
     from the central image management system 20 or the X-ray imaging
     apparatus 410, to select at least one region of the first energy X-ray
     image and the second energy X-ray image, and to generate and display a
     bone or soft tissue image corresponding to the selected region.
<BR><BR>[0178] The X-ray imaging apparatus 410 is the same as the X-ray imaging
     apparatus 310 of FIG. 12, and thus, a detailed description thereof is
     omitted here.
<BR><BR>[0179] The user control apparatus 420 may include a receiver 421 to
     receive the first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image,
     an image display unit 424 to display at least one of the first energy
     X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image, an image information
     extractor 422 to extract bone image information and soft tissue image
     information from the first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray
     image, an input unit 425 to receive at least one region of the X-ray
     image displayed on the display unit 424, and an image controller 423 to
     generate one image containing the bone image information and the soft
     tissue image information.
<BR><BR>[0180] When the image display unit 424 displays at least one of the first
     energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image which are received
     from the central image management system 20 or the X-ray imaging
     apparatus 410, the user may input user selection of at least one of the
     X-ray image displayed on the display unit 424 through the input unit 425.
<BR><BR>[0181] The user control apparatus 320 described with reference to FIG. 11
     may separately generate and display the bone or soft tissue image
     corresponding to the selected region. However, according to one or more
     embodiments, the user control apparatus 420 may generate and display one
     image obtained by combining the bone and soft tissue images corresponding
     to the selected region selected by the image controller 423.
<BR><BR>[0182] In detail, the image information extractor 422 may extract the bone
     image information and the soft tissue image information corresponding to
     an entire X-ray image or the selected image. The image controller 423 may
     generate one image containing both the bone image information and the
     soft tissue image information with respect to the selected region and may
     display the one image on the image display unit 424. The one image may be
     an X-ray image that indicates both bones and soft tissues.
<BR><BR>[0183] FIGS. 14A to 14C are diagrams showing images displayed on an image
     display unit, such as the image display unit 424 of the X-ray imaging
     system 400, according to one or more embodiments.
<BR><BR>[0184] As shown in FIG. 14A, the image display unit 424 may display the
     first energy X-ray image. The user may select a region that is suspected
     to have a lesion or a region that is to be viewed by the user in more
     detail from the first energy X-ray image through the input unit 425.
<BR><BR>[0185] When the user selection is input, one image containing both the
     bone and soft tissue image information corresponding to the selected
     region may be displayed, as shown in FIGS. 14B and 14C. In this case, the
     one image may replace the selected region and may be displayed, as shown
     in FIG. 14B. Alternatively, the one image may be enlarged and displayed
     on an entire screen of the image display unit 424, as shown in FIG. 14C.
<BR><BR>[0186] The user may set the size of the one image through the input unit
     425. Thus, the size of the one image displayed on the image display unit
     424 may be adjusted according to the user setting.
<BR><BR>[0187] When the image controller 423 generates the image containing the
     bone image information and the soft tissue image information, the image
     controller 423 may adjust bone and soft tissue regions of the image to
     exhibit different brightness levels such that the bones and the soft
     tissues may be distinguished from each other.
<BR><BR>[0188] To this end, according to one or more embodiments, the image
     controller 423 may adjust pixel values corresponding to the bone or soft
     tissue region of the image containing the bone image information and the
     soft tissue image information such that the bone region and the soft
     tissue region may exhibit different brightness levels. In this case, a
     lighter region of the bone region and the soft tissue region may be
     optionally set by the image controller 423 or may be determined by user
     selection input to the input unit 425.
<BR><BR>[0189] According to one or more embodiments, the image controller 423 may
     adjust any one of the bone region and the soft tissue region to be
     lighter or darker than the other such that the bone region and the soft
     tissue region may exhibit at different brightness levels. That is, the
     image controller 423 may adjust the bone region and the soft tissue
     region to be lighter or darker than each other.
<BR><BR>[0190] In addition, when the image controller 423 generates the image
     containing the bone image information and the soft tissue image
     information, the image controller 423 may map the bone region and the
     soft tissue region to different color channels, respectively, so as to
     distinguish the bone image and the soft tissue image from each other.
<BR><BR>[0191] The image controller 423 may map the bone region corresponding to
     the bone image information and the soft tissue region corresponding to
     the soft tissue image information to the different color channels,
     respectively. According to one or more embodiments, any color model may
     be used such that the color model includes at least two colors, and thus,
     the type of the color model is not particularly limited.
<BR><BR>[0192] For example, with regard to a RGB model, the image controller 423
     may map the bone image information and the soft tissue image information
     to a red channel and a green channel, respectively, and may generate and
     output the one image containing the bone image information and the soft
     tissue image information. Thus, the bone region and the soft tissue
     region of the image may be displayed red and green, respectively, so as
     to be distinguished from each other.
<BR><BR>[0193] Respective colors mapped to the bone image information and the soft
     tissue image information may be input through the input unit 425 and may
     be optionally set by the image controller 423.
<BR><BR>[0194] An example of an image displayed on the image display unit 424 in a
     case in which the image controller 423 maps the bone region and the soft
     tissue region to different color channels is shown in FIG. 9.
<BR><BR>[0195] In the X-ray imaging systems 300 and 400 according to one or more
     embodiments, the X-ray imaging apparatuses 310 and 410 may reduce
     workload by not generating separate bone and soft tissue images and the
     central image management system 20 may reduce the burden imposed on
     server capacity by not storing the bone image and the soft tissue image.
     In addition, the user may check the bone image or the soft tissue image
     corresponding to a desired region only, instead of the entire all a high
     energy X-ray image, the bone image, and the soft tissue image, thereby
     possibly reducing diagnosis time or fatigue.
<BR><BR>[0196] Hereinafter, a method of controlling an X-ray imaging apparatus
     will be described with regard to one or more embodiments.
<BR><BR>[0197] FIG. 15 is a flowchart of a method of controlling an X-ray imaging
     apparatus according to one or more embodiments.
<BR><BR>[0198] Referring to FIG. 15, a first energy X-ray image and a second
     energy X-ray image may be generated (611). First energy and second energy
     may have different energy levels. First energy X-rays may be irradiated
     and detected to generate the first energy X-ray image and second energy
     X-rays may be irradiated and detected to generate the second energy X-ray
     image. Alternatively, the first energy X-ray image and the second energy
     X-ray image may be generated by irradiating and detecting X-rays with a
     predetermined energy level and then extracting the first energy X-rays
     and the second energy X-rays from the detected X-rays.
<BR><BR>[0199] At least one of the first energy X-ray image and the second energy
     X-ray image may be displayed (612). That is, only one of the first energy
     X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image may be displayed or both
     the first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image may be
     displayed, if necessary. In general, a high energy X-ray image may be
     displayed and used for diagnosis but embodiments are not limited thereto.
<BR><BR>[0200] Selection of at least one region of the displayed X-ray image may
     be input (613). The selected region may have a predetermined area and the
     shape or size of the selected region is not particularly limited.
<BR><BR>[0201] In addition, a bone or soft tissue image corresponding to the
     selected region may be generated and displayed (614). Here, the bone
     image may contain bone image information and indicates bones. The soft
     tissue image may contain soft tissue image information and indicates soft
     tissues.
<BR><BR>[0202] A method of displaying the bone image or the soft tissue image may
     include a method of replacing only the selected region with the bone
     image or the soft tissue image and a method of enlarging the size of the
     bone image or the soft tissue image. Here, the size of the bone image or
     the soft tissue image may be optionally adjusted or may be adjusted
     according to user setting.
<BR><BR>[0203] FIG. 16 is a flowchart of a method of controlling an X-ray imaging
     apparatus that extracts bone or soft tissue image information
     corresponding to a selected region only, according to one or more
     embodiments.

     energy X-ray image may be generated (621) and at least one of the first
     energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image may be displayed
     (622). These operations are the same as in FIG. 15, and thus, a detailed
     description thereof is omitted here.
<BR><BR>[0205] Selection of at least one region of the displayed X-ray image may
     be input (623). When the selection is input, the bone image information
     or soft tissue image information corresponding to the selected region may
     be extracted (624). The extraction of the bone or soft tissue image
     information has been described above in the detailed description of the
     X-ray imaging apparatus and the X-ray imaging system, and thus, a
     detailed description thereof will be omitted here.
<BR><BR>[0206] A bone image containing the extracted bone image information or a
     soft tissue image containing the extracted soft tissue image information
     may be generated and displayed (625). Here, a method of displaying the
     bone image or the soft tissue image is referred to with reference to FIG.
     16.
<BR><BR>[0207] FIG. 17 is a flowchart of a method of controlling an X-ray imaging
     apparatus that extracts bone image information or soft tissue image
     information regardless of user selection according to one or more

     energy X-ray image may be generated (631) and at least one of the first
     energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image may be displayed
     (632).
<BR><BR>[0209] In addition, bone image information or soft tissue image
     information may be extracted from the first energy X-ray image and the
     second energy X-ray image (633). That is, the bone image information or
     the soft tissue image information may be extracted from an entire X-ray
     image, but not from a selected region.
<BR><BR>[0210] Selection of at least one region of the selected X-ray image may be
     input (634).
<BR><BR>[0211] When the selection is input, a bone or soft tissue image containing
     information of the bone image information or the soft tissue image
     information, which corresponds to the selected region, may be generated
     and displayed (635). Here, a method of displaying the bone image or the
     soft tissue image is referred to with reference to FIG. 16.
<BR><BR>[0212] FIG. 18 is a flowchart of a method of controlling an X-ray imaging

     embodiments, and thus, a detailed description thereof is omitted here.
<BR><BR>[0214] Selection of at least one region of the displayed X-ray region may
     be input (643).
<BR><BR>[0215] When the selection is input, one image containing both bone and
     soft tissue image information corresponding to a selected region may be
     generated and displayed (644).
<BR><BR>[0216] In detail, the bone image information and soft tissue image
     information corresponding to the selected region may be extracted from
     the first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image, and the
     one image containing both the bone image information and the soft tissue
     image information may be generated and displayed.
<BR><BR>[0217] Alternatively, the bone image information and soft tissue image
     information corresponding to an entire image may be extracted from the
     first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image, and the one
     image containing both the bone image information and soft tissue image
     information of the extracted information, which correspond to the
     selected region, may be generated and displayed.
<BR><BR>[0218] An operation of generating the one image containing both the bone
     image information and the soft tissue image information may include an
     operation of adjusting brightness levels of a bone region and a soft
     tissue region of the one image and displaying the one image or an
     operation of mapping the bone region and the soft tissue region of the
     one image to different color channels and displaying the one image.
<BR><BR>[0219] In addition, the one image may replace the selected region, may be
     enlarged and displayed, or the size of the selected region may be
     selected according to user setting.
<BR><BR>[0220] Hereinafter, a method of controlling an X-ray imaging system will
     be described with regard to one or more embodiments.
<BR><BR>[0221] FIG. 19 is a flowchart of a method of controlling an X-ray imaging

<BR><BR>[0234] The user control apparatus may receive the first energy X-ray image
     and the second energy X-ray image (673) and may display at least one of
     the first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image (674).
<BR><BR>[0235] Bone image information or soft tissue image information may be
     extracted from the first energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray
     image (675). That is, the bone or soft tissue image information
     corresponding to an entire X-ray image instead of a selected region may
     be extracted.
<BR><BR>[0236] Selection of at least one region of the displayed X-ray image may
     be input (676).
<BR><BR>[0237] When the selection is input, a bone or soft tissue image containing
     information of the bone image information or the soft tissue image
     information, which corresponds to the selected region, may be generated
     and displayed (677).
<BR><BR>[0238] FIG. 22 is a flowchart of a method of controlling an X-ray imaging
     system according to one or more embodiments.
<BR><BR>[0239] Referring to FIG. 22, an X-ray imaging apparatus may generate a
     first energy X-ray image and a second X-ray image (681) and may transmit
     the first energy X-ray image and the second X-ray image to the central

     input (685) and one image containing bone and soft tissue image
     information corresponding to a selected region may be generated and
     displayed (686).
<BR><BR>[0242] In detail, the bone and the soft tissue image information
     corresponding to the selected region may be extracted from the first
     energy X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image and the one image
     containing both the bone image information and the soft tissue image
     information may be generated and displayed.
<BR><BR>[0243] Alternatively, the bone and the soft tissue image information
     corresponding to an entire image may be extracted from the first energy
     X-ray image and the second energy X-ray image and the one image
     containing both the bone and soft tissue image information of the
     extracted information, which corresponds to the selected region, may be
     generated and displayed.
<BR><BR>[0244] An operation of generating the one image containing both the bone
     image information and the soft tissue image information may include an
     operation of adjusting brightness levels of a bone region and a soft
     tissue region of the one image and displaying the one image or an
     operation of mapping the bone region and the soft tissue region of the
     one image to different color channels and displaying the one image.
<BR><BR>[0245] In addition, the one image may replace the selected region, may be
     enlarged and displayed, or the size of the selected region may be
     determined according to user setting.
<BR><BR>[0246] As is apparent from the above description, an X-ray imaging
     apparatus according to one or more embodiments may display a bone or soft
     tissue image, which corresponds to a region selected by a user, thereby
     reducing diagnosis time.
<BR><BR>[0247] In addition, in an X-ray imaging system according to one or more
     embodiments, a first energy X-ray image and a second energy X-ray image
     may be transmitted to a central image management system, a user control
     apparatus may receive the images from the central image management
     system, and a bone or soft tissue image corresponding to the selected
     region may be displayed, thereby possibly reducing burden imposed on
     server capacity of the central image management system as well as
     diagnosis time.
<BR><BR>[0248] In one or more embodiments, any apparatus, system, element, or
     interpretable unit descriptions herein include one or more hardware
     devices or hardware processing elements. For example, in one or more
     embodiments, any described apparatus, system, element, retriever, pre or
     post-processing elements, tracker, detector, encoder, decoder, etc., may
     further include one or more memories and/or processing elements, and any
     hardware input/output transmission devices, or represent operating
     portions/aspects of one or more respective processing elements or
     devices. Further, the term apparatus should be considered synonymous with
     elements of a physical system, not limited to a single device or
     enclosure or all described elements embodied in single respective
     enclosures in all embodiments, but rather, depending on embodiment, is
     open to being embodied together or separately in differing enclosures
     and/or locations through differing hardware elements.
<BR><BR>[0249] In addition to the above described embodiments, embodiments can
     also be implemented through computer readable code/instructions in/on a
     non-transitory medium, e.g., a computer readable medium, to control at
     least one processing device, such as a processor or computer, to
     implement any above described embodiment. The medium can correspond to
     any defined, measurable, and tangible structure permitting the storing
     and/or transmission of the computer readable code.
<BR><BR>[0250] The media may also include, e.g., in combination with the computer
     readable code, data files, data structures, and the like. One or more
     embodiments of computer-readable media include: magnetic media such as
     hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD ROM
     disks and DVDs; magneto-optical media such as optical disks; and hardware
     devices that are specially configured to store and perform program
     instructions, such as read-only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM),
     flash memory, and the like. Computer readable code may include both
     machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher
     level code that may be executed by the computer using an interpreter, for
     example. The media may also be any defined, measurable, and tangible
     distributed network, so that the computer readable code is stored and
     executed in a distributed fashion. Still further, as only an example, the
     processing element could include a processor or a computer processor, and
     processing elements may be distributed and/or included in a single
     device.
<BR><BR>[0251] The computer-readable media may also be embodied in at least one
     application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or Field Programmable Gate
     Array (FPGA), as only examples, which execute (e.g., processes like a
     processor) program instructions.
<BR><BR>[0252] While aspects of the present invention has been particularly shown
     and described with reference to differing embodiments thereof, it should
     be understood that these embodiments should be considered in a
     descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. Descriptions
     of features or aspects within each embodiment should typically be
     considered as available for other similar features or aspects in the
     remaining embodiments. Suitable results may equally be achieved if the
     described techniques are performed in a different order and/or if
     components in a described system, architecture, device, or circuit are
     combined in a different manner and/or replaced or supplemented by other
     components or their equivalents.
<BR><BR>[0253] Thus, although a few embodiments have been shown and described,
     with additional embodiments being equally available, it would be
     appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these
     embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the
     invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their
     equivalents.
